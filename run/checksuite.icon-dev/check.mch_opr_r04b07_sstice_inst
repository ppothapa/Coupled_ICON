# 1. Define the experiment and the files to be checked
#
# EXPERIMENT is the name of the experiment, that defines the experiment descriptor
# file run/exp.<EXPNAME>. EXPNAME is used also for:
# - the output directory name: experiments/<EXPNAME>
# - the output  file names: <EXPNAME>_<TYPE>_<DATE>.nc
# - the restart file names: 
#
export EXPERIMENT='mch_opr_r04b07_sstice_inst'

# TYPES is a list of names identifying the files <EXPNAME>_<TYPE>_<DATE>.nc
# to be checked.
#
export TYPES='atm_3d_ml'

# DATES is a list of dates identifying the files <EXPNAME>_<TYPE>_<DATE>.nc
# to be checked.
#
export DATES='20221201T000000Z'

# RESTART_DATE defines the date and time from which restarts should be performed.
# 
export RESTART_DATE='20221201T000000Z'

#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 
# 2. Define the checksuite mode
#
export MD='tm'

#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 
# 3. Launch the checksuite from run/
